2025-09-18,Did you know that counties with a higher number of unhealthy air quality days in California were also predicted to have a higher number of asthma hospitalizations? Richer counties were predicted to have less of an increase in asthma hospitalizations than poorer counties, but were still predicted to be impacted.,Poisson regression model predicting total asthma hospitalizations in counties in California using number of air quality days labeled as unhealthy/very unhealthy/hazardous as the main predictor and median household income as a covariate with population as an offset. The model includes 95% confidence intervals. Asthma and air quality data by county are from 2015 to 2023. Median household income and population by county data are from 2023.,Model created using population counts and median household income data for California from US Census. Asthma hospitalization rates by county data are from California Department of Public Health. Air quality index data are from the US EPA.
2025-09-17,Acres of Wildfire Burn and Total Annual Precipitation in California from 2019-2024,Did you know that in California years with very low rainfall like 2020 saw some of the largest areas burned by wildfires while wetter years like 2023 had far fewer acres burned?,The data show California’s total annual precipitation and wildfire acres burned from 2019 to 2024. This graph suggests an inverse relationship between precipitation and wildfire destruction. Generally: less rainfall saw more acres burned and more rainfall saw fewer acres burned.,Created using wildfire data from National Interagency Fire Center and CAL FIRE
2025-09-16,Number of Unhealthy Air Quality Days in Counties Across the Contiguous United States (2019–2024),Did you know many counties in the U.S. especially those in the southwest experience hundreds of days each year with unhealthy air? The areas and years with more unhealthy air quality days also happen to have more wildfires (we’ll learn more about wildfires tomorrow!),These maps show the number of days in each county with air quality in the categories Unhealthy; Very Unhealthy; or Hazardous. Counties with missing data appear in gray.,Created using data of Air Quality Index from U.S. EPA from 2019 to 2024.
2025-09-15,Global Coffee Trade Flows of Top Exporters to Key Importers,Did you know that among the top exporters of coffee beans in 2023 Brazil sent the largest shipments especially to the US followed by Vietnam and Colombia?,Sankey diagram showing coffee trade flows (in million kilograms) from top exporters to selected major importers in 2023. Flow widths are proportional to trade weight. Only the largest exporters and major importers were included in the calculations to keep the figure clear and focus on key trade routes.,Created using data from UN Comtrade (2023).
2025-09-14,Heatmap of Chess Checkmate Positions,Did you know that even though more checkmates are possible in the center they usually occur on the top and bottom ranks because kings are more often trapped near the edges in actual games?,The left chessboard shows a heatmap of the number of possible checkmate configurations for the king on each square. Darker squares indicate more potential checkmates. The right chessboard shows where kings are actually checkmated in games. Darker squares indicate squares where checkmates most frequently occur.
