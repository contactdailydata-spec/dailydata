2025-10-01, Shifting Themes in Presidential Inaugural Addresses,Did you know that presidential inauguration address topics have shifted over time? During the world war eras there was more focus on peace in earlier years more attention to constitutional rights and civic duty and today more emphasis on national unity and pride.,This figure shows results from a structural topic model (STM) which is a machine learning technique used to identify recurring themes in large collections of text. The model was applied to all US presidential inaugural addresses to uncover major topics and track how their prominence shifted over time. Each bar represents the proportion of a given topic within a single speech with colors indicating themes such as constitutional rights; peace; national security; and national unity. The visualization highlights how the content of inaugural addresses reflects changing historical contexts and national priorities.
2025-09-30,Countries with the Highest Human Rabies Deaths Over the Last 5 Years (2019–2024),Did you know that rabies is not eradicated and kills thousands of people every year particularly in countries with limited access to post exposure vaccination?,This chart shows the total recorded number of human rabies deaths in the countries with the highest fatalities from 2019 to 2024 highlighting the ongoing impact of the disease. Note that rabies deaths are often under reported and the true number of fatalities may be higher than shown here.,Graph created using rabies data from the World Health Organization.
2025-09-29,Population Growth Acceleration and Deceleration by Country,Did you know that most countries in the world are experiencing slowing population growth while parts of Africa continue to see accelerating growth due to higher fertility rates and younger populations.,The map shows the long-term trend of population growth rates in each country. The color gradient represents the annual change in growth rate in percent per year squared. Orange indicates slowing growth white indicates steady growth and purple indicates accelerating growth. Countries with a negative growth rate representing shrinking populations are included and the gradient indicates whether their decline is speeding up or slowing down.,Map was created using World Bank Population Data.
2025-09-28,Estimated Asthma Hospitalizations by Air Quality at Different Household Incomes in California,Did you know that areas with a higher number of unhealthy air quality days in California were associated with a higher number of asthma hospitalizations? Poorer areas experienced a much greater increase in asthma hospitalizations than richer areas in response to bad air quality.,Poisson regression model estimating total asthma hospitalizations in counties in California using number of air quality days labeled as unhealthy/very unhealthy/hazardous as the main predictor and median household income as a covariate with population as an offset. The model includes 95% confidence intervals. Asthma and air quality data by county are from 2015 to 2023. Median household income and population by county data are from 2023.,Model created using population counts and median household income data for California from US Census. Asthma hospitalization rates by county data are from California Department of Public Health. Air quality index data are from the US EPA.
2025-09-27,Acres of Wildfire Burn and Total Annual Precipitation in California from 2019-2024,Did you know that in California years with very low rainfall like 2020 saw some of the largest areas burned by wildfires while wetter years like 2023 had far fewer acres burned?,The data show California’s total annual precipitation and wildfire acres burned from 2019 to 2024. This graph suggests an inverse relationship between precipitation and wildfire destruction. Generally: less rainfall saw more acres burned and more rainfall saw fewer acres burned.,Created using wildfire data from National Interagency Fire Center and CAL FIRE
2025-09-26,Number of Unhealthy Air Quality Days in Counties Across the Contiguous United States (2019–2024),Did you know many counties in the U.S. especially those in the southwest experience hundreds of days each year with unhealthy air? The areas and years with more unhealthy air quality days also happen to have more wildfires (we’ll learn more about wildfires tomorrow!),These maps show the number of days in each county with air quality in the categories Unhealthy; Very Unhealthy; or Hazardous. Counties with missing data appear in gray.,Created using data of Air Quality Index from U.S. EPA from 2019 to 2024.
2025-09-25,Global Coffee Trade Flows of Top Exporters to Key Importers,Did you know that among the top exporters of coffee beans in 2023 Brazil sent the largest shipments especially to the US followed by Vietnam and Colombia?,Sankey diagram showing coffee trade flows (in million kilograms) from top exporters to selected major importers in 2023. Flow widths are proportional to trade weight. Only the largest exporters and major importers were included in the calculations to keep the figure clear and focus on key trade routes.,Created using data from UN Comtrade (2023).
2025-09-24,Heatmap of Chess Checkmate Positions,Did you know that even though more checkmates are possible in the center they usually occur on the top and bottom ranks because kings are more often trapped near the edges in actual games?,The left chessboard shows a heatmap of the number of possible checkmate configurations for the king on each square. Darker squares indicate more potential checkmates. The right chessboard shows where kings are actually checkmated in games. Darker squares indicate squares where checkmates most frequently occur.
